# sensorprogrammed_stm32f334R8_onepulsemode

In this proyect, the objective is the same as the one before. Generate pulses that can be controlled by its frequency and hence the will turn on some signals. In this case, we are using One Pulse Mode of the nucleo board stm32 F334R8. 

For this a 

 Moreover, we will try to obtain the data in digital to obtain a mean value, at maximun resolution obtaining the maximum samples. 
 ADC and DMA will be used for the acquisition
